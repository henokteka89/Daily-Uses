FOr DATABASE
--Check the Current State of the Database: Verify the current state of the database in the availability group.
SELECT db.name, dbs.synchronization_state_desc
FROM sys.databases AS db

Clean Up Metadata:
On the primary replica:

ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [YourAGName] REMOVE DATABASE [YourDatabaseName];


Force Cleanup (if necessary):
If the database still appears, you can use the following steps to force the cleanup.

Remove the database from the availability group on the secondary replica:

ALTER DATABASE [YourDatabaseName] SET HADR OFF;

Remove the database from the availability group on the primary replica:
ALTER DATABASE [YourDatabaseName] SET HADR OFF;
ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [YourAGName] REMOVE DATABASE [YourDatabaseName];

--Verify the Removal: Verify that the database has been successfully removed from the availability group.
SELECT db.name, agd.database_state_desc
FROM sys.databases AS db
LEFT JOIN sys.dm_hadr_database_replica_states AS agd
ON db.database_id = agd.database_id;


-- Remove from Secondary Replica (if still present): If the database still shows up in the secondary replica, ensure it is removed from there as well.
USE [master];
DROP DATABASE [YourDatabaseName];
